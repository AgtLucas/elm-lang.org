## Hello World

## Motivation

I want to create great products. That is it. A programming language is useful
to the extent that it helps me do that.

I started working on Elm because it was too freaking hard to center things on
a webpage. After *20 years* of work from companies like Google, Mozilla, Apple,
and Microsoft, how could it possibly be the case that vertical centering is
still a nightmare? How can it be the case that reusing UI components is
laughably difficult.

Over the past 40 years, programming language researchers have made some
extraordinarily *useful* discoveries. The kind of stuff that makes it easier
to create great products, but these advances have been obscured by academic
jargon and insular communities. The result is that extremely *useful* ideas
are not widely known or used.

Elm is an effort to:

  * Pick out the advances that really truly matter
  * Present them in a way that is easy to understand and use
  * Make it *pleasant* to create great products
